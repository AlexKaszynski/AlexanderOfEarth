# Introduction/ReadMe
  Hi, my name is (Alex Kaszynski](https://github.com/AlexanderOfEarth)
  
  I'm a recent Colorado State University(CSU) graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science. I'm interested computer Science because having been a fan of game development since early on in school, I wanted to learn more about the language behind it, and eventually got hooked on the problem-solving nature of Computer Science. I found that with my interest in art and design, I resonated more with front-end development, and UI design.

  Fullstack refers to the entire domain of web applications, both front- and back-end. While I know some back-end, I'm much more interested in the front-end side of web development. Speaking of, I was led to MThree by my desire to further my education specifically in Front-End Development, as I feel I was partially robbed of some of my education due to the pandemic. I've been training under them for about 2 months.

### Currently Doing
  I'm currently working with and being trained by MThree for Front-End Web Development software, including Javascript, React, MongoDB, etc.
  You can see my progress on these in my repositories.
  
### Personal Interests
  In my spare time outside of coding and training, I like to make artwork (pixel and hand-drawn), play games, and excerise.
  
### Known Languages
  *Spoken*: Polish, English
  
  *Coding*: Javascript, Python, React, Java, HTML&CSS, C++, R
